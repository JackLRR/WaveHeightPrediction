# WaveHeightPrediction

1."open sea wave prediction" can be used in the following situations: training a model with data at three stations(NDBC No.41046、No.41047、No.41048 stations), and using the model for wave height prediction at another station(NDBC No.41049 station).(data source:https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/)

2."single point training-prediction" is used to train the model on data at one station and make wave height predictions at the same station(NDBC No.41049 station).(data source:https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/)

3."coastal wave height prediction" is used to predict the wave height in the coastal waters(XiaoMaiDao station).(data source:Observation data in Chinese oceanic stations http://ocean.ckcest.cn/)

4."long time wave height prediction" is used to predict the wave height in the long time interval(NDBC No.41008、No.41044、No.42058、No.44008、No.46059、No.46073、No.46085、No.51000 station).(data source:https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/)
